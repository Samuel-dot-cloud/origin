        <h2>1.Introduction.</h2>
        <p>First and foremost i would like to welcome you to my Portfolio page. My name is <em>Samuel Kigotho Wahome</em>. I am a beginner level aspiring programmer at Moringa School. I see myself as more of a thinker, as i tend to meditate frequently before
            executing a project.

        <h1>3.About Me.</h1>
        <p>In this section, you will get to know a bit more about me.</p>
        <p>To begin with, i am fresh out of high School having attended Mang'u High School for my higher education. I am predominantly a quiet person but quite social in many settings. I currently do not have a job though i do have experience handling finances
            and i am very willing to take up new challenges as i am not a huge fan of the 'comfort zone'.



        </p>
        <p>I am an aspiring entrepreneur as is the reason i decided to join Moringa School since i have a passion for programming but could not get much headwind by myself. I do believe that by taking this course, i can gain the relevant skills to aid me
            as trudge onwards to become the business leader i so wish to be. I was able to settle on Moringa due to the referalls i got from friends and acquaintances, terming it as the <strong>best</strong>school to join.

                that reason, i am also an avid photographer. Armed with a digital camera, video and photo editing software, and an external flash, i like to take artistic images of nature or people during my free time. Due to this fact i happen to get
                in touch with nature a lot.
