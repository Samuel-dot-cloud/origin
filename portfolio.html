        <h2>1.Introduction.</h2>
        <p>First and foremost i would like to welcome you to my Portfolio page. My name is <em>Samuel Kigotho Wahome</em>. I am a beginner level aspiring programmer at Moringa School. I see myself as more of a thinker, as i tend to meditate frequently before
            executing a project. <img src="images/gettyimages-497813532-170667a.jpg">Without much ado, we shall now dive into my current but growing portfolio. </p>

        <h1>3.About Me.</h1>
        <p>In this section, you will get to know a bit more about me.</p>
        <p>To begin with, i am fresh out of high School having completed my higher education. I am predominantly a quiet person but quite social in many settings. I currently do not have a job though i do have experience handling finances and i am very willing
            to take up new challenges as i am not a huge fan of the 'comfort zone'. </p>
        <p>I am an aspiring entrepreneur as is the reason i decided to join Moringa School since i have a passion for programming but could not get much headwind by myself. I do believe that by taking this course, i can gain the relevant skills to aid me
            as trudge onwards to become the business leader i so wish to be. I was able to settle on Moringa due to the referalls i got from friends and acquaintances, terming it as the <strong>best</strong>school to join. </p>
        <p>'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy', the wise men once said. Due to this fact, i happen to have a plethora of activities that i do engage in during my free time. To begin with, i am an avid reader, have scrolled through works of great
            men and women, searching for knowledge. So far, i have been able to read the following books:

        <p>I view myself as one who appreciates nature, and due to that reason, i am also an avid photographer. Armed with a digital camera, video and photo editing software, and an external flash, i like to take artistic images of nature or people during
            my free time. Due to this fact i happen to get in touch with nature a lot. <img src="images/gettyimages-840948468-170667a.jpg">Unfortunately, that is all i have to share for now.</p><img src="images/gettyimages-1076066980-612x612.jpg"></div>
